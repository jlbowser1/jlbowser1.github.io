<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<p1>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</p1>
<p2>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p2>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:<p3>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</p3>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <p3>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who i sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of lamp, even when he is asleep.."</p3> And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <p1>I felt the need of protecting him, as if himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p1>
